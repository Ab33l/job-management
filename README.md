# Job-Management-Service

# The Job Management Service primarily provides its users with the ability to schedule when they would like to send email messages to other users, for example, a reminder message. 

# I used Gmailâ€™s Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) server to send emails. I have integrated the Quartz API to the prototype with the main aim of allowing users to schedule their emails.
